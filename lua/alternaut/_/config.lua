--- User-defined config for the plugin.

--- "Modes" are the different types of things you can swap between, such as
--- tests, CSS files, templates, etc. Each mode contains a set of providers.
--- @field modes? table<string, table<string, alternaut.UserConfig.Provider>>

--- A provider defines exactly how a source file relates to a target file.
--- Providers are defined within "modes". For example, saying a `.css` file is
--- co-located with an `.html` file is a provider. You could define another
--- provider for `.less` files, and another for `.scss`. All would live in
--- a `style` mode that knows how to resolve any type of style-related assets.
--- @class alternaut.UserConfig.Provider
---
--- A pattern defines how a source file's name relates to a target file's
--- name. For example, a test file might always end in `{name}_spec.py`.
--- Patterns have access to the following variables:
---
--- - `{name}`: The name of the source file, without the extension.
--- - `{ext}`: The extension of the source file.
---
--- There can be many patterns. Each permutation is searched in the order it
--- is defined.
--- @field patterns string[]
---
--- Possible file extensions. If this is a list of strings, it's assumed that
--- the source and target files share the same extensions.
--- @field extensions string[] | alternaut.UserConfig.Extensions
---
--- Directories searched while resolving target files. This defaults to the
--- current directory. If you override it, you may want to explicitly include
--- the current directory (`./`).
--- @field directories? string[]
---
--- Possible file extensions, both for the target file and the source file.
--- Alternaut needs the source file extensions in order to navigate back. Note
--- that the leading `.` is inferred and optional.
--- @class alternaut.UserConfig.Extensions

--- All possible file extensions for the target file. For example, `.ts` and
--- `.tsx` might both be valid extensions for a unit test. These are searched
--- in the order they are defined.
--- @field target string[]
---
--- All possible file extensions for the source file. Depending on the
--- language or tool, these might be different from the target file. This
--- allows Alternaut to navigate back to the source file.
